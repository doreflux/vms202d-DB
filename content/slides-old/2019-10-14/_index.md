# The Culture Industry

<br><br>
> Enlightenment, understood in the widest sense as the advance of thought, has always aimed at liberating human beings from fear and installing them as masters. Yet the wholly enlightened earth radiates under the sign of disaster triumphant.

> &mdash; Horkheimer & Adorno, _Dialectic of Enlightenment_

???
How can this be, the authors ask. How can the progress of modern science and medicine and industry promise to liberate people from ignorance, disease, and brutal, mind-numbing work, yet help create a world where people willingly swallow fascist ideology, knowingly practice deliberate genocide, and energetically develop lethal weapons of mass destruction? Reason, they answer, has become irrational.

# "Critical Theory"

Key Figures, Institute for Social Research:

* Max Horkheimer (1895-1973)
* Theodor Adorno (1903-1969)
* Walter Benjamin (1892-1940)
* Herbert Marcuse (1898-1979)
* Friedrich Pollock (1894-1970)
* Leo Lowenthal (1900-1993)
* Eric Fromm (1900-1980)

???
The Institute was founded in 1923 thanks to a donation by Felix Weil with the aim of developing Marxist studies in Germany. In 1933, due to the Nazi takeover and forced closure of the Institute, the Institute was temporarily transferred, first to Geneva and then in 1935 to Columbia University, New York.  Advancing both marxist critical theory and Freudian psychoanalysis.

In 1941, Horkheimer moved to Pacific Palisades, near Los Angeles. He built himself a bungalow near other German intellectuals, among whom were Bertold Brecht and Thomas Mann as well as with other people interested in working for the film industry (Wiggershaus 1995, p. 292). Other fellows like Marcuse, Pollock and Adorno followed shortly, whereas some remained in New York. Only Benjamin refused to leave Europe and in 1940, while attempting to cross the border between France and Spain, committed suicide.

# Critical Theory

> <q>Critical Theory</q> in the narrow sense designates several generations of German philosophers and social theorists in the Western European Marxist tradition known as the Frankfurt School. According to these theorists, a <q>critical</q> theory may be distinguished from a <q>traditional</q> theory according to a specific practical purpose: a theory is critical to the extent that it seeks human <q>emancipation from slavery</q>, acts as a <q>liberating &hellip; influence</q>, and works <q>to create a world which satisfies the needs and powers</q> of human beings (Horkheimer 1972, 246) &hellip; a critical theory provides the descriptive and normative bases for social inquiry aimed at decreasing domination and increasing freedom in all their forms.

# Vertical Integration

> Everything is so tightly clustered that the concentration of intellect reaches a level where it overflows the demarcations between company names and technical sectors. The relentless unity of the culture industry bears witness to the emergent unity of politics.

# Going Forward:

* If culture (superstructure) lags behind changes in the economy (base), are we witnessing new forms of culture in the context of late capitalism?

    * Post-Fordism / De-industrialization
    * Rise of (speculative) financial capital
    * Growing gap between rich and poor / precarity and the gig economy
    * Neoliberalism

PostFordism:   Growth of labor processes and workflows relying on information and communication technologies and digital labor.
