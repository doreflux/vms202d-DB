# Barthes' Contribution to Semiotics

![Roland Barthes](barthes.png)
* **Denotation**<br>
--
    The _literal_ meaning of a sign

--
* **Connotation**<br>
--
    Social, cultural, &amp; historical meanings that are "added" to denotation

--
* **Myth**<br>
--
    The hidden set of rules, codes, &amp; conventions through which meanings, which in reality are specific to certain groups, are _rendered universal and given for a whole society._  They are **naturalized**.

## Barthes’ Question:<br /><br />
### _What Is Photography?_

[ An ontological question ]

---

# Difficulty in Seeing Photography
--

> “A specific photograph, in effect, is never distinguished from its referent . . . or at least it is not immediately . . . it is not impossible to perceive the photographic signifier (certain professionals do so), but it requires . . . reflection.” (p. 5)

--

> “Whatever it grants to vision and whatever its manner, a photograph is always invisible.  It is not it that we see.” (p. 6)

---

# Photography is _deictic_

--
* A photograph “points a finger” (p. 6)<br><br>

--
* A photograph is _“here, now”_ but it always points to _“what was there, then.”_<br><br>

--
* “Look” “See” “Here it is”

---

# studium<br>punctum

---

# studium

--
* an affective relationship to the photograph characterized by “general and . . . _polite interest_,” the order of “liking”<br><br>

--
* focus on the informational character of photography:  what did the photographer (“operator”) intend to convey?<br><br>

--
* apprehended “in reverse”, as spectator

---

# punctum

--
* “this element which rises from the scene, shoots out of it like an arrow, and pierces me” (p. 26)<br><br>

--
* Latin word: wound, prick, or mark made by a pointed instrument<br><br>

--
* “that accident which pricks me” (p. 27)<br><br>

--
* NOT the result of analysis:  “In order to perceive the punctum, no analysis would be of any use to me” (p. 42)
