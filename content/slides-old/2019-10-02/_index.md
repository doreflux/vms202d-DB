# Realism

* A key tenet:  “the realist image depicts something as if it would be seen by the human eye.”  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The goal is to produce reality “as it is.”</span>

* “a **set of conventions** or a **style of art or representation** that is understood at a given historical moment to accurately represent nature or the real or to convey and interpret accurate or universal meanings about people, objects, and events in the world.”  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Realism is historical</span>.

# episteme

Michel Foucault's concept


> “The question for us is **not** which approach to realism has resulted in the most accurate representations of the world at any given time, but what do the different approaches to realism that we find in art and visual culture tell us about the culture and politics of a given social context.”

><cite>&mdash; Sturken &amp; Cartwright</cite>

???
episteme - a different way of ordering things, or the relation between words and things, the seeable and the sayable.  different ways of organizing and representing knowledge about things.
