# Intertextuality

* The referencing of one text _(or image)_ within another.  In popular culture, intertextuality refers to the incorporation of one text within another in a <span style="text-decoration: underline">reflexive</span> fashion.  

--

* _Intertextual references assume that the viewer knows the people, events, and/or cultural products being referenced._

* How do you see?<br />(from what point of view, voyeuristic stare vs. glance, objectively?)<br /><br />
--

* _Do_ you see? (blindness)<br /><br />
--

* Do you have the "right to look"?  (Do you claim it, assert it?)<br /><br />
--

* Or are you compelled to look?  (Through force, authority, desire)

## Construction

* Mirrors don't reflect back faithfully; they distort<br /><br />
* The "gap" between the representation and the thing represented matters<br /><br />
* Photography as [**framing reality**](http://www.iwojima.com/raising/raisingb.htm)
