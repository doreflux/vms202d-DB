# Small Group Discussion

### Working with Foucault’s main theses, what might we say about how authorship functions in the context of internet discourse and social media?

* What rules/institutions govern valid statements?  
* Do we hold people accountable for texts they produce?  How?
* What are the specific characteristics of texts/speech on social media in relation to their authors? Anonymity? Publicity? How is this different from other kinds of authorship?
* How does one determine WHO an author is in relation to the social media they produce?  One person? Many?  A corporation? 
* How does that WHO change how those texts are understood or interpreted?

# Amalia Ulman’s _Excellences and Perfections_ (2014)
> <smalL>“Through [instagram] posts, Ulman fabricated a fictional character whose story unfolded in three different episodes, presenting her acting as three different personas: a 'cute girl', then a 'sugar babe' and finally a 'life goddess'. "The idea was to bring fiction to a platform that has been designed for supposedly "authentic" behavior, interactions and content. The intention was to prove how easy an audience can be manipulated through the use of mainstream archetypes and characters they've seen before." Ulman's Instagram selfies were mainly taken sneaking into hotels and restaurants in Los Angeles and posted as if they documented her real life.”</small>

# Language &amp; Identity

> _“Linguistics has recently provided the destruction of the Author with a valuable analytical tool by showing that the whole of the enunciation is an empty process, functioning perfectly without their being any need for it to be filled with the person of the interlocutors. [...] The text is a tissue of quotations drawn from the innumerable centres of culture.”_ (Barthes, The Death of the Author)

> _“What does it matter who is speaking?”_ (Foucault, What is an Author?)

--
<hr />

> _“The way people talk always changes, driven language-internally or by social pressures. At any given moment in a language or dialect, certain aspects of speech are stable, and others are undergoing a change in progress. How does it happen? Who is responsible for it? How does the internet affect the process of language change?”_ (Manuel Arturo Abreu, Online Imagined Black English)

# Today's Guiding Questions:

If we are, according to structuralism, made _(interpellated)_ as subjects through language _(signs)_, and not the other way around, do linguistic differences matter when considering the identity of the speaker/what is being said?  

How do identity and difference determine access to linguistic codes? 

Which codes are dominant? How does that dominance work in practice?

# Some Vocabulary

**Black English, or African American Vernacular English:** a variety of English natively spoken by most often by working- and middle-class African Americans and some Black Canadians.  AAVE has its own unique grammatical, vocabulary and accent features, distinct from “standard English”.  AAVE is a distinct dialect, with its own grammatical rules and words that sound and look like “standard English” but have different meanings.  (Wikipedia)  AAVE is just one of many American vernacular dialects.

**Imagined Black English** (Abreu): “the phenomenon of non-black English speakers with no fluency using real or imaginary linguistic features of Black English.”  According to Abreu, the use of IBE is an _appropriation_ of AAVE, and that phenomenon changes both AAVE and “standard English”

**Code Switching**: “when a speaker alternates between two or more languages, or language varieties, in the context of a single conversation.” (Wikipedia)

* “the same stereotyped indexical meanings that white supremacist culture imposes on Black English endow it with covert prestige in non-institutional contexts.” (Abreu)
--

* In other words, IBE is often adopted for expressive purposes that rely on racist stereotypes of Black people
--

* This use “reshapes the meaning of the borrowed material” into forms that advance the interest of the dominant class, often through the _deracialization_ of Black English

# Tracing the erased origins of "Yas Queen", aka "Yas Kween"

<small>
* The term “yas” orginated in queer communities of color and in ballroom culture of the 1980s and 1990s, along with words like “shade” and “reading”

* Both yas and queen have meanings in this context that deviate from their use in “standard english”

* Queen, once a derogatory term for gay men and gender non-conforming people, was reappropriated in this context as a form of praise, endearment and belonging

* &quot;yas&quot; sounds similar to yes, but connotes recognition and praise

* These terms were then later picked up and popularized in the white gay male community

* "Yas Queen" went viral on the internet when it was heard in a fan video of lady gaga (you can hear a man in the video calling "yas queen")

* Think about how this follows from Abreu’s argument about the modes through which appropriated words from AAVE enter mainstream culture through "upwardly mobile" groups (white women, white gay men) with affinities to "alterity"
