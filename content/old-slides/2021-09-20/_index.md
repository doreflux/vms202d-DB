# Gender and the Gaze
## September 20, 2021

---

<br>
> One might simplify this by saying: _men act_ and _women appear_. Men look at women. Women watch themselves being looked at. This determines not only most relations between men and women but also the relation of women to themselves. The surveyor of woman in herself is male: the surveyed female. Thus she turns herself into an object &mdash; and most particularly an object of vision: a sight.

>&mdash; <cite>John Berger, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ways of Seeing</span>, p. 47

Active / passive binary
looking vs watching
Women adopt the gaze of men - reflexive

# Laura Mulvey on the male gaze in Hollywood cinema

--
<br />
<blockquote>
<div style="background: rgba(0,0,0,0.4); color: white; padding: 20px;">
"In a world ordered by sexual imbalance, pleasure in looking has been split between active/male and passive/female. The determining male gaze projects its phantasy on to the female form which is styled accordingly. In their traditional exhibitionist role women are simultaneously looked at and displayed, with their appearance coded for strong visual and erotic impact so that they can be said to connote to-be-looked-at-ness"<br /><br />
&mdash; Laura Mulvey, "Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema" (1975: 11)</div></blockquote>
