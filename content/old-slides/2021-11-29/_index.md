## [The Visual Archive Project of the Global Imaginary](http://www.the-visual-archive-project-of-the-global-imaginary.com/)

???

Founded in 2007, the Visual Archive Project of the Global Imaginary is a an on-going, indipendent and self-managed digital database that explores the interplay between visual culture and globalization. This research project aims to build a historical and visual account of the multidimensional process of change and transformations we are witnessing in the early twenty-first century. The visual investigation takes into consideration that, if the rise of nation-states built homogenous cultures around the core concept of nationality—national ideology and its underlying social imaginary, so that people could feel, for example, American, French or Italian—in the last few decades the twenty-four-hours-a-day-seven-days-a-week spread of global culture flows have dramatically changed this perspective. The urgency to build a visual archive that attempts to grasp and collect some concrete tracks of this process is grounded on the awareness that in the last few decades commercial culture is increasingly and dramatically affecting ‘local-national’ meanings by reshaping them around the ‘global'.

> Globalization creates a visual narrative that can ‘condense’ spatial-symbolic scales of the ‘local-national’ and the ‘global’ in one single place. These symbols of the ‘global’, however, may not be entirely unproblematic in their representations of the cultural identity of place, but they remain essential tools to access the global imaginary. Therefore, I argue that as much as globalization is an economic and cultural force, as it is a visual-ideological phenomenon.

### Electronic Disturbance Theater:<br />[Transborder Immigrant Tool](http://tbt.tome.press/)

![EDT](edt.jpg)

???
Transborder Immigrant Tool (TBT) repurposes inexpensive used mobile phones that have GPS antennae. The project approximates a code-switch, a queer technology. Its software aspires to guide “the tired, the poor,” the dehydrated—citizens of the world—to water safety sites. Concomitantly, its platform offers poetic audio sustenance.

Incapable of resolving the long histories of fear, prejudice and misunderstanding on both sides of the Mexico-U.S. border, TBT remembers the often overlapping traditions of transcendental and nature writing, earthworks, conceptual art, performance, border art, locative media, and visual and concrete poetries. It also learns from the efforts of humanitarian aid organizations like Water Station, Inc. and Border Angels. Poetry-in-motion, TBT navigates the borderlands of G.P.S. as a “global positioning system” and what, in another context, Laura Borràs Castanyer and Juan B. Gutiérrez refresh as a “global poetic system.”

“A rapist on your way” - a networked protest that has spanned Bogotá, Santiago, Barcelona, Madrid, Berlin, New York, London and Paris.

The call was published on November 27, 2019, after its 25N intervention was viralized through social networks within the framework of the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women. In each country, the lyrics were adapted or some stanzas were added according to the contexts that women live.

Land "Recognition"
> “We acknowledge that we stand, live and work on the ancestral homeland of the Coharie, Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, Haliwa-Saponi, Lumbee, Meherrin, Occaneechi Band of the Saponi, Sappony, and Waccamaw Siouan peoples whose lands include what is known today as North Carolina. We recognize those peoples as well as the many Indigenous people who live and work in the region today.”

# Reflection / Refraction

What paths have we traveled?  How far have we come?  Where are we headed?  What did we not see along the way?   Who did we leave behind?
