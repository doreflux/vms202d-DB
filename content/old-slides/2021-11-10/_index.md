# Postmodern

* After, or in reaction to, or a rejection of the modern

--

* *However,* the "post" is always already a modern logic: of breaking from the past/from tradition.

--

* Recognition of the above can invoke an affect of despair (there is no "outside" of modernity? of late capitalism?)
--
,<br />or perhaps nihilism &rarr; ("f*ck it, let's party")

--

* A certain kind (ironic?) of nostalgic relation to the past:  nostalgia for nostalgia

# Postmodern Nostalgia

Fredric Jameson, "Postmodernism, or the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism" (1984)

--

* the collective social desire to appropriate an idealized past through aesthetic representation (or, to use Baudrillard’s term, simulation). 

* Emptying signs of the past of their historical referents, and reinscribing these signs with connotations of a vague “pastness” that construct Barthesian “mythologies” of the past.

* Privileging the past as "lost object of desire” while effectively effacing “real history" ("genuine historicity")

# Modernity vs Postmodernity
<small>


| Modernity (or The Age of Enlightenment Empiricism and Humanism)| Postmodernity (or The Post Truth Era?)<div style="margin-right: 10vw">&nbsp;</div> |
| :----------- | :----------- |
| belief in the possibility of a unified human subject | subjectivity is fragmented, contradictory; unity and coherence are effects of performativity |
| belief in fundamental, intrinsic, and universal (or classic) transcendent values, rights, and essential, autonomous, and self-sufficient objects, texts, and actions. | Relativism: views these constructs as contingent, insufficient, and lacking transcendence. |
| Belief in “master” or “meta narratives,” i.e., religion, science, psychoanalysis, Enlightenment myths of progress, economic determinism | questions master narratives in favor of difference, plurality, and multiplicity. |
| The application of Reason leads to a progressive movement toward civilization, democracy, freedom,scientific advancement. The Enlightenment is _prescriptive_: a means of building a better society. | There is no objective means upon which to predicate morality and right/just governance. Postmodern theory is _descriptive_ of the human condition; it describes an _impasse_ in philosophy and social/political relations. |
| reality, immediacy, the original  | hyperreality, hypermediacy, the simulacra |
| a continuous self-conscious, self-referential attitude, promoting social change and able to _absorb_ cultural postmodernism as one of the “isms” of the modern. | a philosophical approach toward the _deconstruction_ of modernism and its epistemologies. |

# Postmodernism

An artistic/architectural and literary movement.

* **Art/Archictecture:** Rejected and replaced modernism in art. Characterized by anti-authoritarianism, or refusal to recognize the authority of any single style or definition of what art should be; and collapse of the distinction between high culture and mass or popular culture, and between art and everyday life. Postmodern art/architecture can be also characterized by a deliberate use of earlier styles and conventions, and an eclectic mixing of different artistic and popular styles and mediums. (Warhol, Lichtenstein, Cindy Sherman, Carolee Schneemann, Michael Graves)

* **Literature:** a form of literature which is marked, both stylistically and ideologically, by a reliance on such literary conventions as fragmentation, paradox, unreliable narrators, often unrealistic and downright impossible plots, games, parody, paranoia, dark humor and authorial self-reference.  (Thomas Pynchon, Don DeLillo, Kurt Vonnegut, David Foster Wallace)

# Pastiche

* “an imitation that announces itself as such” (PoL 325)

* Etymology: French _pastiche_ &rarr; from Italian _pasticcio_ (“pie, something blended”) &rarr; from Vulgar Latin *pasticium* &rarr; from Latin _pasta_ (“dough, pastry cake, paste”) &rarr; from Ancient Greek _παστά_ (pastá, “barley porridge”) &rarr; from _παστός_ (pastós, “sprinkled with salt”). 

* If <u>**parody** imitates to _critique_</u>, then <u>**pastiche** imitates to _pay homage_</u>, or simply just to mimic.

Discuss:  Mode of intertextuality but without insider knowledge of allusion; more explicit?
