## Course Description

This course surveys all aspects of the circulation and reception of images, and examines a wide variety of visual media, from photography and film to television and video, from the Internet to Virtual Reality, from ultrasound to MRI technology, and from painting and sculpture to the built environment. Students will learn visual competency and media literacy; will consider the impact of advertising; will think about how science and medicine use the visual, and how the power of the visual has been deployed in politics and culture throughout history. To begin exploring these interrelationships, do read _The New York Times’_ article, [“A Rogue State Along Two Rivers: How ISIS Came to Control Large Portions of Syria and Iraq”](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/07/03/world/middleeast/syria-iraq-isis-rogue-state-along-two-rivers.html).

The course will also consider how conscious and unconscious desires elicit particular responses to media and imagery; how difference and otherness (gender, sexuality, class, race, ethnicity and religion) are inscribed visually; and how perception determines experience and representation in general. Students will learn to recognize the many ways in which the visual organizes social life, and how the visual may be used to dominate or liberate humans, animals, and nature. For example, consider [how Instagram might be affecting fragile ecosystems](https://www.racked.com/2018/8/27/17719792/outdoor-influencers-leave-no-trace-bears-ears).

We will give close attention to how the visual organizes information, creates spectacle, and operates in surveillance systems, as well as how the visual participates in the administration and governance of society, as in the military gear supplied yearly by the Pentagon to police departments throughout the United States.[^1]

We will also study how ideology is visualized in different communities, cultures, and nations; how societies view and naturalize self-perceptions; and [how symbolic constructions determine participation in the world](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/05/deviate-science-seeing-perception-brain-beau-lotto/).
