# What does it mean to study visual culture?

> "Visual culture is concerned with visual events in which **information**, **meaning** or **pleasure** is sought by the **consumer** in an **interface with visual technology**.  By visual technology I mean any form of **apparatus** designed to be looked at or to enhance natural vision, from oil painting to television and the internet."

> &mdash; Nicholas Mirzoeff, *[An Introduction to Visual Culture](https://www.google.com/books/edition/An_Introduction_to_Visual_Culture/hhajBE0mUfwC?hl=en)*, p. 3

???

Difference between information and meaning?  Value?
