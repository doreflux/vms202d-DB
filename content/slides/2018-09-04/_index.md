### The Signifier (Sr)<br /><br />

* The _physical form_ of the sign.
    * pencil marks
    * vocal sounds
    * pixels on a screen<br /><br />
* The part of the sign that we perceive with our senses.

### The Signified (Sd)<br /><br />

* The Signified is not the REFERENT (the “Thing Itself”)<br /><br />
* Instead, the signified is the <span style="color:#FF2600; text-decoration:underline;">thought</span>, <span style="color:#3DACFF; text-decoration:underline;">concept</span>, or <span style="color:#00D100; text-decoration:underline;">mental image</span> we may have of the referent.<br /><br />
* The signified is attached to or “conjured up” by the signifier.

*  We can call physical marks by the name “signifier” <span style="color:#00D100;">_only when and if_</span> they conjure a <span style="color:#FF2600;">signified</span> to form a sign.

* If they don’t, then they are NOT signifiers.

### A Quick Game of
# PICTIONARY<sup>©</sup>

---

* Pictionary is the joint struggle to create a sign, such that the marks you make on the page become a signifier that “conjures up” the appropriate signified in the mind of your partner.<br /><br />

* You may just end up making marks on the page that never become signifiers…

<span style="color:red;">e.g. WHAT THE _*&%!!#_ ARE YOU DRAWING??!!??</span>

Signs are:

* Abstract
* Arbitrary *and* Conventional
* Ambiguous

---

## Signs are <span style="text-decoration:underline">NOT</span> the concrete things that they represent…

--- 

#### There is no <span style="color:red;">_necessary_</span> relationship between the signifier and the signified.

{{% fragment %}} * For example, there is no reason why we use “d” “o” “g” to refer to that cute fuzzy thing that’s yapping at the door.<br /><br /> {{% /fragment %}}

{{% fragment %}} * Instead, we use “dog” because of our <span style="color:red;">CONVENTIONS...</span> {{% /fragment %}}

Charles Sanders Peirce developed a schema for understanding the different ways a sign can relate to its referent, asking:

>How <span style="color:#3DACFF">_MOTIVATED_</span> is the sign by the ‘thing itself’?

---

## Degrees of Motivation
#### (A continuum)<br /><br />

* Symbol
* Icon
* Index

---

## Symbol

* _**LOW**_ Degree of Motivation
* The relationship between the sign and its referent is <span style="text-decoration:underline;">completely</span> <span style="color:#00D100;">ARBITRARY</span> or based on <span style="color:#00D100;">SOCIAL CONVENTION</span>.<br /><br />

{{% fragment %}} Ex. The word “Spoon” or . . .  {{% /fragment %}}
