## Louis Althusser (1970)<br />“Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses”

---

## Ideology (Althusser):

--
* is "the imaginary relationship of individuals to their real conditions of existence"<br><br> 

--
* "has a material existence" (e.g. ideology exists in/as an _apparatus_:  an institution, a power structure, and its practices.)<br><br>

--
* "hails or interpellates concrete individuals as concrete subjects." 

---

<br><br><br>
> "I shall then suggest that ideology 'acts' or 'functions' in such a way that it 'recruits' subjects among the individuals (it recruits them all), or 'transforms' the individuals into subjects (it transforms them all) by that very precise operation which I have called interpellation or hailing, and which can be imagined along the lines of the most commonplace everyday police (or other) hailing: 'Hey, you there!"

## Interpellation:

* "Hey you there"<br><br>
* Ideology interpellates the individual as a subject<br><br>
* Ideology  subjects,  its  function  is  to  subject,  to  unfold the  process  of  subjectivation.

## Stuart Hall

For Stuart Hall, the process of communication involves the articulation of linked but distinctive moments:

* production<br><br>
* circulation<br><br>
* distribution/consumption<br><br>
* reproduction<br><br>

# Reproduction?

>“Once accomplished, the discourse must then be translated– transformed, again – into social practices if the circuit is to be both completed and effective. If no “meaning” is taken, there can be no “consumption”. If the meaning is not articulated in practice, it has no effect.” (Stuart Hall)

# Different "Decoding Positions"

1. **Dominant / Hegemonic**:<br>The "Preferred Reading" or interpretation.<br><br>
--

2. **Negotiated**:<br>A Negotiated Reading - Accepting some of preferred reading, rejecting or ignoring other parts.<br><br>
--

3. **Oppositional / Counter-Hegemonic**:<br>A “Globally Contrary” or Oppositional Reading.

---

## Hegemony

Stuart Hall adopts this term from Italian philosopher Antonio Gramsci

* Dominant ideologies offered and experienced as _"common sense"_

* Dominant ideologies are locked in struggle with other "counter-hegemonic" forces so their dominance is never guaranteed.
