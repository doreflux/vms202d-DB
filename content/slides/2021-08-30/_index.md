# The Signified (Sd)<br /><br />

* The Signified is not the REFERENT (the "Thing Itself")<br /><br />
* Instead, the signified is the <span style="color:#FF2600; text-decoration:underline;">thought</span>, <span style="color:#3DACFF; text-decoration:underline;">concept</span>, or <span style="color:#00D100; text-decoration:underline;">mental image</span> we may have of the referent.<br /><br />
* The signified is attached to or “conjured up” by the signifier.

<br><br><br><br>

*  We can call physical marks by the name “signifier” <span style="color:#00D100;">_only when and if_</span> they conjure a <span style="color:#FF2600;">signified</span> to form a sign.

--

* If they don’t, then they are NOT signifiers.

### Is this a signifier?

--
It is, _**if**_ and only if, it conjures a mental concept (signified), such as:

--
* A map to my apartment.<br><br>

--
* A woman reclining on a chair.

# A Quick Game of<br>PICTIONARY<sup>©</sup>

---
<br /><br />

* Pictionary is the joint struggle to create a sign, such that the marks you make on the page become a signifier that “conjures up” the appropriate signified in the mind of your partner.<br /><br />

--
* You may just end up making marks on the page that never become signifiers…

<span style="color:red;margin-left:15%;">e.g. WHAT THE _*&%!!#_ ARE YOU DRAWING??!!??</span>

## Signs are:

* Abstract<br><br>
--

* Arbitrary *and* Conventional<br><br>
--

* Ambiguous

---
class: fit-h1
# Signs are <span style="text-decoration:underline">NOT</span> the concrete things that they represent…

--- 

--
#### There is no <span style="color:red;">_necessary_</span> relationship between the signifier and the signified.

--
* For example, there is no reason why we use “d” “o” “g” to refer to that cute fuzzy thing that’s yapping at the door.<br /><br />

--
* Instead, we use “dog” because of our <span style="color:red;">CONVENTIONS...</span>

Denotative vs Connotative Meaning (Barthes)

---

<br><br><br>
Charles Sanders Peirce developed a schema for understanding the different ways a sign can relate to its referent, asking:

>How <span style="color:#3DACFF">_MOTIVATED_</span> is the sign by the 'thing itself'?
