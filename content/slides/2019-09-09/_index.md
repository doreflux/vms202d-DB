# Syntagm and Paradigm

---
# Syntagm

* Syntagms define a sequential "grammar" to signs:<br><br>`subject-verb-object` or `this and this and this`<br><br>
* Syntagmatic relationships are about **positioning**, the _syntax_ of a sentence or an image.

_"John ate an octopus."_   ≠  _"An octopus ate John."_

# Syntagm

Poets and artists and ad execs play with the syntagmatic grammar of visual and textual signs

```html
so much depends
upon

a red wheel
barrow

glazed with rain
water

beside the white
chickens

- William Carlos Williams
```

# Paradigm

* Paradigms refer to **sets** of signs that can be substituted for each other and still convey meaning.<br><br>
--

* Convention or logic indicates a _set_ of signs that "can" or "should" be substituted for each other:<br><br>
    _"John cooked **fish**."_ |  _"John cooked **corn**."_ | _"John **grilled** corn."_<br><br>

--

* Some paradigmatic substitutions render a collection of signs _poetic_ &mdash; 
--

`"The sun cooked the pavement."`
--

&mdash; or sometimes _meaningless_&colon;<br> 
--
`"John cooked semiotics furiously."`

---

Discuss&colon;<br>How do the paradigmatic and syntagmatic axes relate to an advertising campaign?  To culture jamming?

Pierre Bourdieu  
_Distinction:  A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste_ (1979 / 1984).

Explores relationships between:
* economic class and taste<br><br>
* economic class and social capital

---

According to Bourdieu, judgements of taste express a class-based <span style="text-decoration:underline;">**habitus**</span>, and are one of the defining elements of social identity.

> <q>Nothing more clearly affirms one's 'class', nothing more infallibly classifies, than tastes in music...there is no more 'classificatory' practice than concert-going, or playing a 'noble' instrument.</q><br /><cite>&mdash; Bourdieu (1979) Distinction, p. 18</cite>
