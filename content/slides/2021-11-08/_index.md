# What is the Public Sphere?

* Benedict Anderson: National-scale media help foster an "imagined community" of the nation
* "Mass media" - experience of simultaneity (commonality of experiencing events at the same time)
* "Public Sphere" - "private people gathered together as a public and articulating the needs of society with the state" (Jurgen Habermas)
* (idealized) space of democratic politics, a democratic "commons"
* Distinct from "private sphere" (domestic space)
* A _discursive_ space (Michael Warner) - where political discourse happens


???
The term was originally coined by German philosopher Jürgen Habermas who defined the public sphere as "made up of private people gathered together as a public and articulating the needs of society with the state”.

Rise of the bourgeois public sphere — gathering in coffee shops, reading newspapers and debating the issues of the day

Habermas stipulates that, due to specific historical circumstances, a new civic society emerged in the eighteenth century. Driven by a need for open commercial arenas where news and matters of common concern could be freely exchanged and discussed—accompanied by growing rates of literacy, accessibility to literature, and a new kind of critical journalism—a separate domain from ruling authorities started to evolve across Europe. "In its clash with the arcane and bureaucratic practices of the absolutist state, the emergent bourgeoisie gradually replaced a public sphere in which the ruler's power was merely represented before the people with a sphere in which state authority was publicly monitored through informed and critical discourse by the people”.[24]    Democracy replaces Sovereign Domination

# Critiques of Public Sphere (Nancy Fraser)

* concept of unified public sphere is fallacy based on exclusion:

    * of women because of relative immobility in relation to the private sphere

    * of the poor because of the necessity of being relatively free from the vicissitudes of the economic sphere
--

* theorization of:

    * _counterpublics_: groups subordinate to dominant public but still sites from which people can speak up in society

    * _networked publics_: publics and counterpublics formed in online discussion forums

# The Spectacle

* Not a collection of images, but **a social relationship between people that is mediated by images.**

--

* Both the outcome and goal of the dominant mode of production.

--

* Specific Manifestations:
    * News or Propaganda
    * Advertising
    * The Actual Consumption of Entertainment

---
# The Spectacle, Cont'd

* The spectacle is real, even though it falsifies reality

--

* Feuerbach:  “the present age...prefers the sign to the thing signified, the copy to the original, representation to reality”

--

* Proclaims the predominance of <u>appearances</u> and asserts that all human life, which is to say all social life is mere appearance.

--

* The "chief product of modern society"

--

* Being &rarr; Having &rarr; Appearing

# The Spectacle and the Spectator

Passive spectatorship / The Power to Consume

# Leisure and the Spectacle

* “Free time” - Illusion of leisure as freedom:

> There can be no freedom apart from activity, and within the spectacle all activity is banned - a corollary of the fact that all real activity has been channeled into the global construction of the spectacle.  So what is referred to as “liberation from work,” that is, increased leisure time, is a liberation neither within labor itself nor from the world labor has brought into being. [27]

* The work of consumption, keeping up appearances (a “surplus ‘collaboration’ is required of the workers. [43]).

# Critique as Gathering/Assembly

> The role of avant-garde currents, wherever they may appear, is to link these people and these experiences together; to help unify such groups and the coherent basis of their project. We have to publicize, elucidate and develop these initial gestures of the next revolutionary era. They can be recognized by the fact that they concentrate in themselves new forms of struggle and a new content (whether latent or explicit): the critique of the existing world. Thus the dominant society, which prides itself so much on its constant modernization, is now going to meet its match, for it has finally produced a modernized negation.

# Art and Everyday Life

* The construction of "situations"

* Practices to capture “Living Desires” and distinguish them from “Pseudo-needs”

Debord defined psychogeography in 1955 as "the study of the precise laws and specific effects of the geographical environment, consciously organized or not, on the emotions and behavior of individuals." Debord advocated for, "active observation of present-day urban agglomerations, "to discover how environments effected the behavior and feelings of individuals and, conversely, how to make new environments that created the possibility for "a new mode of behavior.” a reconfiguration of urban environments to allow for creativity and play.

Influenced by the 19th century French poet Charles Baudelaire's concept of the flâneur, a kind of dandy who wandered the city, dérive, or drift, was defined by Debord as, "the practice of a passional journey out of the ordinary through a rapid changing of ambiences." The concept, which was also called Situationist drift, was an essential component of psychogeography, as a place was 'mapped' by individuals wandering freely through the urban environment and finding their own ambient site
