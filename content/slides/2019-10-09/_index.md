# Benjamin's "Project"

* Occasion
--

    * A transformation in the <span style="text-decoration: underline">**capitalist mode of production**</span> (the rise of industrial mass production), associated with alienation and de-skilling of the proletariat masses.   

--
    * Culture (the superstructure) reflects changes in the (economic) base, but more slowly.

--
* Benjamin’s Goal:  “defining the tendencies of art under the present conditions of production” (p. 252)

---
# Main Theses

1.  _“The work of art has always been reproducible . . . But the technological reproduction of artworks is something new.”_<br>(p. 252) 

2. Photography and film can now “reproduce all known works of art, profoundly modifying their effect.” (p. 253)

    * reproduction <span style="text-decoration: underline">_diminishes_ the **aura** of an artwork</span> . . .<br><br>
    * . . . <span style="text-decoration: underline">and brings it _closer_ to the **masses**</span>.

---
# Aura

* Aura - energy or emanation surrounding an object, part of its vital essence<br><br>
--

* Intimately tied to **tradition** and to **ritual**<br><br>
--

* “the here and now of the work of art—its unique existence in a particular place.” (p. 253)<br><br>
--

* Authenticity - “the quintessence of all that is transmissible in it from its origin on, ranging from its physical duration to the historical testimony relating to it” (p.254)

# Main Theses, Cont'd

Technological reproducibility:

* <q>detaches the reproduced object from the sphere of tradition</q> (p. 254)<br>&rarr;  modern?<br><br>
* <q>substitutes a mass existence for a unique existence</q> &rarr; mass &equals; sameness?<br><br>
* causes <q>exhibition value</q> to replace <q>cult value</q> (p 257)<br><br>

# Main Theses, Cont'd

Human perception is historical:

* <q>The way in which human perception is organized—the medium in which it occurs—is conditioned not only by nature but by history.</q> (p. 255)<br><br>

* The **optical unconscious of film**

# Main Theses, Cont'd

Technological reproducibility:

* <q>revolutionizes</q> the <q>social function of art</q> &rarr; no longer ritual, but _politics_ (p. 257)<br><br>
* <q>changes the relationship of the masses to art</q> (p. 264)<br><br>

    * <q>reception in distraction</q> (p. 269):  <q>the distracted masses absorb the work of art into themselves</q>
    
    * The power of habit &mdash; training ground for new perceptions

# Reception in Distraction
<br>
> Even the distracted person can form habits. What is more, the ability to master certain tasks in a state of distraction proves that their performance has become habitual. The sort of distraction that is provided by art repre­sents a covert measure of the extent to which it has become possible to per­form new tasks of apperception. Since, moreover, individuals are tempted to evade such tasks, art will tackle the most difficult and most important tasks wherever it is able to mobilize the masses. It does so currently in film.
