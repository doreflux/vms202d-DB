# Intertextuality in *Mood 4 Eva*

* **Intertextuality**: The referencing of one text _(or image)_ within another.   
   
   In popular culture, intertextuality refers to the incorporation of one text within another <span style="text-decoration: underline">in a ***reflexive*** fashion</span>.   


* _Intertextual references assume that the viewer *knows* the people, events, and/or cultural products being referenced._

# How Do You Look? - Looking as Practice

* How do you appear?  (To others / to yourself)

--

* _Do_ you appear (in/visibility)?

--
* How do you see?

    * Point of view / identity &amp; background (race, class, gender, sexuality, religion, ...) 
    * Quality of the Look (gaze, glance, stare, voyeuristic)
    * "Through" some medium (screen, lens, etc)
--

* _Do_ you see? Are you unable to see?  What is hidden from your gaze?
--

* Do you have the "right to look"?  (Do you have to claim or assert it?)

--

* Are you compelled to look?  (Through force, authority, desire)

# Visuality

> “Whereas the term vision refers to the physical capacity to see, the concept of visuality refers to the ways that **vision is shaped through social context and interaction** [...] Visuality is a term that calls our attention to how the visual is **caught up in power relations that involve the structure of the visual field** as well as the politics of the image”   
> &mdash; Sturken &amp; Cartwright, p. 22

# Practicing Looking: Classroom v. Zoom

Free Writing (5 minutes):   
   
   What are the differences between the in-person classroom experience and zoom?

* What do you see vs. what remains hidden?
* How do you see in each space?  How do you appear to yourself and others?
* Is your "right to look" different in each space?  How?
* Where / how might one assert agency over the visual field in each space?

### Visual culture is concerned with *histories of representation*

* Re-present: literally, to "show again"

* "The use of language, marks and images to depict, symbolize, or portray and make meaning from reality (the world around us)" (Sturken & Cartwright, pp. 18-19)

* Some representations we think of as <span class="underline">mimetic</span> (aim to be a "mirror copy" of the real/material world). 

* But all representation is **mediated** in some way, refracting that mirror image.

## Construction

* Mirrors don't reflect back faithfully; they distort<br /><br />
* The irreducible "gap" between the representation and the thing represented (the "thing itself") *matters*<br /><br />
