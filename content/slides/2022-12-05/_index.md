# The Global Flow of Visual Culture

**Anthropocene Visuality**<br/>

Coined by Nick Mirzoeff to describe the effects of technologies and climate change not only on the environment but on modes of seeing:
> “The aesthetics of the Anthropocene emerged as an unintended supplement to imperial aesthetics—it comes to seem natural, right, then beautiful—and thereby anaesthetized the perception of modern industrial pollution.”

* George Wesley Bellows, Forty-Two Kids (1907) - (left) note the black water
* Claude Monet, Impression: Sun Rising, 1873 (port of Le Havre in Normandy) (top-right)
* Claude Monet, Unloading Coal, c. 1875 (London) (bottom-right) - the yellow of sulfured coal smoke


Mirzoeff proposes that Anthropocene visuality is a mode that typically obscures rather than reveals the environmental changes and social injustice caused by humankind’s impacts on the planet

# Flow

![Flow](flow.png)

P386 - Global Flow is not a new phenomenon.  Textbook maps the history, for example, of the global flow of woodblock image and moveable type reproduction techniques from Asia to Europe from the first millennium.   But they also suggest that post-WWII global flow has taken a specific valence: increased cross-border migration; global trade liberalization; emergence of multinational/transnational corporations alongside the decline of the power of national sovereignties; rise of global humanitarian efforts; formation of non-geographically bound diasporas and imagined communities.

> Globalization creates a visual narrative that can ‘condense’ spatial-symbolic scales of the ‘local-national’ and the ‘global’ in one single place. These symbols of the ‘global’, however, may not be entirely unproblematic in their representations of the cultural identity of place, but they remain essential tools to access the global imaginary. As much as globalization is an economic and cultural force, it is also a visual-ideological phenomenon.

“A rapist on your way” - a networked protest that has spanned Bogotá, Santiago, Barcelona, Madrid, Berlin, New York, London and Paris.

The call was published on November 27, 2019, after its 25N intervention was viralized through social networks within the framework of the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women. In each country, the lyrics were adapted or some stanzas were added according to the contexts that women live.
