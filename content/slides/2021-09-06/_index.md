Pierre Bourdieu  
_Distinction:  A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste_ (1979 / 1984).

Explores relationships between:
* economic class and taste<br><br>
* economic class and social capital

---

According to Bourdieu, judgements of taste express a class-based <span style="text-decoration:underline;">**habitus**</span>, and are one of the defining elements of social identity.

> <q>Nothing more clearly affirms one's 'class', nothing more infallibly classifies, than tastes in music...there is no more 'classificatory' practice than concert-going, or playing a 'noble' instrument.</q><br /><cite>&mdash; Bourdieu (1979) Distinction, p. 18</cite>

# Ideology:

* As the _naturalization of the contingent._ (Barthes)<br><br>

--

* As _propaganda_.<br><br>

--

* As _false consciousness_. (Marx)

class: title

## Louis Althusser (1970)<br />“Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses”

---

## Ideology (Althusser):

--
* is "the imaginary relationship of individuals to their real conditions of existence"<br><br> 

--
* "has a material existence" (e.g. ideology exists in/as an _apparatus_:  an institution, a power structure, and its practices.)<br><br>

--
* "hails or interpellates concrete individuals as concrete subjects." 

---

<br><br><br>
> "I shall then suggest that ideology 'acts' or 'functions' in such a way that it 'recruits' subjects among the individuals (it recruits them all), or 'transforms' the individuals into subjects (it transforms them all) by that very precise operation which I have called interpellation or hailing, and which can be imagined along the lines of the most commonplace everyday police (or other) hailing: 'Hey, you there!"

## Interpellation:

* "Hey you there"<br><br>
* Ideology interpellates the individual as a subject<br><br>
* Ideology  subjects,  its  function  is  to  subject,  to  unfold the  process  of  subjectivation.

* We are constantly interpellated through the media we encounter in daily life
* This may be more or less direct (advertising often addresses the viewer directly with the imperative or a question: “embrace your cozy time” “got milk?” )

* We are constantly interpellated through the media we encounter in daily life
* This may be more or less direct (advertising often addresses the viewer directly with the imperative or a question: “embrace your cozy time” “got milk?” )
* Interpellations “address” us with implicit ideas that we are encouraged to accept: ideological notions of  gender, sexuality, race, class, standards of beauty, citizenship, etc.

# Interpellation is a *negotiated* practice

...Subjects may not feel addressed by a cultural text, may resist interpellation, or may reproduce codes and conventions unfaithfully or inaccurately

# Encoding / Decoding
## Stuart Hall

## Stuart Hall

For Stuart Hall, the process of communication involves the articulation of linked but distinctive moments:

* production<br><br>
* circulation<br><br>
* distribution/consumption<br><br>
* reproduction<br><br>

# Reproduction?

>“Once accomplished, the discourse must then be translated– transformed, again – into social practices if the circuit is to be both completed and effective. If no “meaning” is taken, there can be no “consumption”. If the meaning is not articulated in practice, it has no effect.” (Stuart Hall)

# Different "Decoding Positions"

1. **Dominant / Hegemonic**:<br>The "Preferred Reading" or interpretation.<br><br>
--

2. **Negotiated**:<br>A Negotiated Reading - Accepting some of preferred reading, rejecting or ignoring other parts.<br><br>
--

3. **Oppositional / Counter-Hegemonic**:<br>A “Globally Contrary” or Oppositional Reading.

---

## Hegemony

Stuart Hall adopts this term from Italian philosopher Antonio Gramsci

* Dominant ideologies offered and experienced as _"common sense"_

* Dominant ideologies are locked in struggle with other "counter-hegemonic" forces so their dominance is never guaranteed.
