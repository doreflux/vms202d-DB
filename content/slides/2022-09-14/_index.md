## Review:  Hall's Three "Decoding Positions"

1. **Dominant / Hegemonic**:  The "Preferred Reading" or interpretation.

2. **Negotiated**:  A Negotiated Reading   
    Accepting some of preferred reading, rejecting or ignoring other parts

3. **Oppositional / Counter-Hegemonic**:   
    A “Globally Contrary” or Oppositional Reading

---

## Hegemonic / Hegemony

Stuart Hall adopts this term from Italian philosopher Antonio Gramsci

--

* Dominant ideologies offered and experienced as _"common sense"_

--

* Dominant ideologies are locked in struggle with other "counter-hegemonic" forces so their dominance is never guaranteed.

--

* Culture as a "whole way of ~~life~~ struggle."

# Barthes' critique of originality

>"**The text** [image? artwork?] **is a tissue of quotations drawn from the innumerable centres of culture . . . the writer** [artist? marketing exec? influencer?] **can only imitate a gesture that is always anterior, never original.  His** [sic] **only power is to mix writings** [signs?], **to counter the ones with the others.**"

>“To give a text an Author is to impose a limit on that text, to furnish it with a final signified, to close the writing. Such a conception suits criticism very well, the latter then allotting itself the important task of discovering the Author (or its hypostases: society, history, psyche, liberty) beneath the work: when the Author has been found, the text is 'explained' &ndash; victory to the critic.”

### Foucault's Response to / Critique of Barthes
>“It is not enough . . . to repeat the empty affirmation that the author has disappeared. . .   Instead, we must locate the space left empty by the author's disappearance, follow the distribution of gaps and breaches, and watch for the openings its disappearance uncovers.”

## Foucault:  _Author Function_

---

# Author Function: _Four Characteristics_
--

1. Linked to the **juridical** and **institutional** system that encompasses, determines, and articulates the universe of discourses.<br><br>
--

1. Does not affect all discourses in the same way at all times and in all types of civilizations<br><br>
--

1. Defined by _specific and complex operations_.<br><br>
--

1. It does not refer simply to a real individual, since it can give rise simultaneously to different selves, to several subjects – _positions_ that can be occupied by different classes of individuals.

serves “a classificatory function. Such a name permits one to group together a certain number of texts, define them, differentiate them from and contrast them to others.” (Foucault, 210)
