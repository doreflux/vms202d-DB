# The Culture Industry
## October 14, 2019

<br><br>
> Enlightenment, understood in the widest sense as the advance of thought, has always aimed at liberating human beings from fear and installing them as masters. Yet the wholly enlightened earth radiates under the sign of disaster triumphant.

> &mdash; Horkheimer & Adorno, _Dialectic of Enlightenment_

Reason, they answer, has become irrational.
