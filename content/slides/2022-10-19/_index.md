# Visual Technologies, Reproduction,<br />and the Copy: Part 1<br />October 19, 2022

# Review

### Walter Benjamin, “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction.”

* What concepts need clarifying?

    *  aura
    *  cult value vs exhibition value
    *  optical unconscious


* How would you summarize Benjamin's argument about the _effect_ mechanical reproduction has on a work of art?

* Why might this be important now?

???

Benjamin argues that mass reproduction substitutes a mass existence for a unique one, so it simultaneously diminishes the aura of the work of art but brings it closer to the masses.

aura “the here and now of the work of art—its unique existence in a particular place.”

cult value -- being hidden, singular // exhibition value - being  on display, being seen

our senses are historical, and deeply tied to the technologies with which we interact with and represent the world

# Benjamin's "Project"

* Occasion

--

    * A transformation in the <span style="text-decoration: underline">**capitalist mode of production**</span> (the rise of industrial mass production), associated with alienation and de-skilling of the proletariat masses.   

--
    * Culture (the superstructure) reflects changes in the (economic) base, but more slowly.

--
* Benjamin’s Goal:  “defining the tendencies of art under the present conditions of production” (p. 252)

# Key Concept - _Economic Determinism_

# Assumptions

* The technology of a given society is a fundamental determinant (or cause) of the form of that society.

* Technology is _autonomous_

* Changes in technology are the primary drivers of change in the society.

Discuss:  why this painting? 
autonomous technology
Overall fear that technology is driving cultural, social, political economic change without our control (Remember -- modernity installed "man" as the locus of control)

# Mass Production

![Painting Production Line](dafen2.png)<br>
20 - 50 paintings per day

???
8 yuans per copy = $1.20   
2000 - 3000 yuans per month (roughly $300-$450)

DISCUSS Capitalism   
	
* exploitation? - van gogh specialist - factory production 50 paintings each day / yet freedom from factory work

* globalization - 
	* —> rise of moneyed classes in China — class habitus (Bourdieu) of creative labor (piano school)
	* —> Dutch bank, chinese & foreign clients, only invests US dollars - $100,000 minimum; Van Gogh as gift
	* —> US tourists
	* —> Visual culture of hotel chains

Copyists are not artists, but rather painters or "art workers"
