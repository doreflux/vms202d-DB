**Intertextuality**
: The referencing of one text _(or image)_ within another.  In popular culture, intertextuality refers to the incorporation of one text within another in a <span style="text-decoration: underline">reflexive</span> fashion.  

    Intertextual references assume that the viewer knows the people, events, and/or cultural products being referenced.

* Mirrors don't reflect back faithfully; they distort
* The "gap" between the representation and the thing represented matters
* photography as <a href="http://www.iwojima.com/raising/raisingb.htm">framing reality</a>
