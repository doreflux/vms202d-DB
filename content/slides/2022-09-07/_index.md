# Barthes' Contribution to Semiotics

![Roland Barthes](barthes.png)
* **Denotation**<br>
--
    The _literal_ meaning of a sign

--
* **Connotation**<br>
--
    Social, cultural, &amp; historical meanings that are "added" to denotation

--
* **Myth**<br>
--
    The hidden set of rules, codes, &amp; conventions through which meanings, which in reality are specific to certain groups, are _rendered universal and given for a whole society._  They are **naturalized**.

# Syntagm and Paradigm

---
# Syntagm

* Syntagms define a sequential "grammar" to signs:<br><br>`subject-verb-object` or `this and this and this`<br><br>
* Syntagmatic relationships are about **positioning**, the _syntax_ of a sentence or an image.

_"John ate an octopus."_   ≠  _"An octopus ate John."_

# Syntagm

Poets and artists and ad execs play with the syntagmatic grammar of visual and textual signs

```html
so much depends
upon

a red wheel
barrow

glazed with rain
water

beside the white
chickens

- William Carlos Williams

# Paradigm

* Paradigms refer to **sets** of signs that can be substituted for each other and still convey meaning.<br><br>
--

* Convention or logic indicates a _set_ of signs that "can" or "should" be substituted for each other:<br><br>
    _"John cooked **fish**."_ |  _"John cooked **corn**."_ | _"John **grilled** corn."_<br><br>

--

* Some paradigmatic substitutions render a collection of signs _poetic_ &mdash; 
--

`"The sun cooked the pavement."`
--

&mdash; or sometimes _meaningless_&colon;<br> 
--
`"John cooked semiotics furiously."`

---

Discuss&colon;<br>How do the paradigmatic and syntagmatic axes relate to an advertising campaign?  To culture jamming?
