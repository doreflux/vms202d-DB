## Review:  Barthes' notion of _myth_<br /><br />

**myth**
: connotations that function _ideologically;_ that is, meanings that are specific certain groups are made to seem <span style="text-decoration:underline;">natural, univeral, and given for a whole society</span>.   

Ideology as the _naturalization of the contingent._

# Ideology:

{{% fragment %}} * As the _naturalization of the contingent._ (Barthes) {{% /fragment %}}

{{% fragment %}} * As false consciousness (Marx)<br /><br /> {{% /fragment %}}

Louis Althusser (1970)<br />“Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses”

---

## Ideology (Althusser):

{{% fragment %}} * is "the imaginary relationship of individuals to their real conditions of existence" {{% /fragment %}} 

{{% fragment %}} * "has a material existence" (e.g. ideology exists in/as an _apparatus_:  an institution, a power structure, and its practices.) {{% /fragment %}} 

{{% fragment %}} * "hails or interpellates concrete individuals as concrete subjects." {{% /fragment %}} 

---

 "I shall then suggest that ideology 'acts' or 'functions' in such a way that it 'recruits' subjects among the individuals (it recruits them all), or 'transforms' the individuals into subjects (it transforms them all) by that very precise operation which I have called interpellation or hailing, and which can be imagined along the lines of the most commonplace everyday police (or other) hailing: 'Hey, you there!"

---

### Interpellation:

* "Hey you there"
* Ideology interpellates the individual as a subject
* Ideology  subjects,  its  function  is  to  subject,  to  unfold the  process  of  subjectivation.
