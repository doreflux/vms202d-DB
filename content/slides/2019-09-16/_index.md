>“To give a text an Author is to impose a limit on that text, to furnish it with a final signified, to close the writing. Such a conception suits criticism very well, the latter then allotting itself the important task of discovering the Author (or its hypostases: society, history, psyche, liberty) beneath the work: when the Author has been found, the text is 'explained' &ndash; victory to the critic.”

### Foucault's Response to / Critique of Barthes
>“It is not enough . . . to repeat the empty affirmation that the author has disappeared. . .   Instead, we must locate the space left empty by the author's disappearance, follow the distribution of gaps and breaches, and watch for the openings its disappearance uncovers.”

> &mdash; <cite>Foucault, "What Is An Author?" (209)</cite>

## Foucault:  _Author Function_

---

# Author Function: _Four Characteristics_
--

1. Linked to the **juridical** and **institutional** system that encompasses, determines, and articulates the universe of discourses.<br><br>
--

1. Does not affect all discourses in the same way at all times and in all types of civilizations<br><br>
--

1. Defined by _specific and complex operations_.<br><br>
--

1. It does not refer simply to a real individual, since it can give rise simultaneously to different selves, to several subjects – _positions_ that can be occupied by different classes of individuals.

serves “a classificatory function. Such a name permits one to group together a certain number of texts, define them, differentiate them from and contrast them to others.”
