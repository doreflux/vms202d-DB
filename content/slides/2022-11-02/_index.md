# Critique of "Hermeneutics of Suspicion"

Gramsci:  
"Pessimism of the intellect, optimism of the will." (echoed by Stuart Hall)

Lawrence Grossberg:
> ...that is what I want to suggest: that we need to think—more and better.  That we have to find an **optimism of the intellect**

Mirzoeff's **"the right to look"**

Fred Moten's "Black Ops" and **"affirmative politics of fugivity"**

Bruno Latour, "Why Has Critique Run Out of Steam?":

> The critic is not the one who debunks, but the one who **assembles**. The critic is not the one who lifts the rugs from under the feet of the naive believers, but the one who offers the participants arenas in which to **gather**.

Eve Sedgewick: **"reparative critical practices"** against the hegemony of "paranoid critical practices"

# Media as "Extensions" of Human Sensorium

Marshall McLuhan

> The effects of technology do not occur at the level of opinions or concepts, but alter sense ratios or patterns of perception.

???
Media and sensory perception

Key concept:  The medium is the message

in McLuhan’s own words
[play clip]

Message / Massage / Mass Age

It’s not the content, but the medium that matters (the content of a medium is always another medium anyway -- 
The content of radio is text; of text --> speech, of television --> film, etc

McLuhan is concerned about how media affects our “total situation” . . . particularly our senses.  Media alters our relationships to each other and ourselves.

## Media and Extension

???
Media alters our sense ratios -- Put another way, McLuhan wants to highlight media as extensions of the human body, of human sensorium

[Play clip]

Ask students to think of extensions that are also amputations
Automobile --> reduction in walking culture, effect on city form (no sidewalks in Durham), pollution

# Medium Specificity vs. Convergence

Media Convergence (Henry Jenkins)

???

A term used to refer to the combination of media together into one point of access or one conglomerate form. The combination of formerly different technologies such as telephone, email, camera, and musical listening system into one device (a “smart” phone) is an example of media convergence.

The Undersea Network examines the cultural and environmental dimensions of transoceanic cable systems, beginning with the telegraph cables that formed the first global communications network and extending to the fiber-optic infrastructure that carries almost international Internet traffic.

In Cultures in Orbit, Lisa Parks suggests that the convergence of broadcast, satellite, and computer technologies necessitates an expanded definition of “television,” one that encompasses practices of military monitoring and scientific observation as well as commercial entertainment and public broadcasting.

The contributors to Assembly Codes examine how media and logistics set the conditions for the circulation of information and culture. They document how logistics—the techniques of organizing and coordinating the movement of materials, bodies, and information—has substantially impacted the production, distribution, and consumption of media. At the same time, physical media, such as paperwork, along with media technologies ranging from phone systems to software are central to the operations of logistics.
