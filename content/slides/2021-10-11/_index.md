# Benjamin's "Project"

* Occasion

--

    * A transformation in the <span style="text-decoration: underline">**capitalist mode of production**</span> (the rise of industrial mass production), associated with alienation and de-skilling of the proletariat masses.   

--
    * Culture (the superstructure) reflects changes in the (economic) base, but more slowly.

--
* Benjamin’s Goal:  “defining the tendencies of art under the present conditions of production” (p. 252)

---
# Main Theses

1.  _“The work of art has always been reproducible . . . But the technological reproduction of artworks is something new.”_<br>(p. 252) 

2. Photography and film (especially) “reproduce all known works of art, profoundly modifying their effect” and also "captur[e] a place of [their] own among the artistic processes" (p. 253)

    * reproduction <span style="text-decoration: underline">_diminishes_ the **aura** of an artwork</span> . . .<br><br>
    * . . . <span style="text-decoration: underline">brings it _closer_ to the **masses**</span>.

---
# Aura

* Aura - energy or emanation surrounding an object, part of its vital essence<br><br>
--

* Intimately tied to **tradition** and to **ritual**<br><br>
--

* “the here and now of the work of art—its unique existence in a particular place.” (p. 253)<br><br>
--

* Authenticity - “the quintessence of all that is transmissible in it from its origin on, ranging from its physical duration to the historical testimony relating to it . .. the weight it derives from tradition” (p.254)

---
# But is the loss of the aura really so bad?

--
<br />
> "for the first time in world history, technological reproducibility eman­cipates the work of art from its parasitic subservience to ritual." (p. 269)

* Artworks are more accessible to more people

* Breaks some deep historical "myths" about artworks, artistic genius, uniqueness

---
# Main Theses, Cont'd

Technological reproducibility:

* <q>detaches the reproduced object from the sphere of tradition</q> (p. 254)<br>&rarr;  modern?<br><br>
* <q>substitutes a mass existence for a unique existence</q> &rarr; mass &equals; sameness?<br><br>
* causes <q>exhibition value</q> to replace <q>cult value</q> (p 257)<br><br>

???

# Reproducibility . . . 

affects the "value" of the world of art:

* The value of a work is, with the shift to reproducibility, almost entirely contained in its exhibition value

* Works of art are also more freely able to circulate as commodities

* Berger: "this value is in fact a substitute for what paintings lost when the camera made them reproducible"

* The purpose/use of artwork shifts from ritual to politics, the organization of the masses

# Main Theses, Cont'd

Human perception is historical:

* <q>The way in which human perception is organized—the medium in which it occurs—is conditioned not only by nature but by history.</q> (p. 255)

* The emergence of industrialization, urbanization, mass production changes the environment in revolutionary ways; Benjamin sees film as a sort of training of the senses in this new environment.

* Film techniques like montage, close-up reveal new optical realities, new unconscious optics: an **"optical unconscious"**

# Main Theses, Cont'd

Technological reproducibility:

* <q>revolutionizes</q> the <q>social function of art</q> &rarr; no longer ritual, but _politics_ (p. 257)<br><br>
* <q>changes the relationship of the masses to art</q> (p. 264)

    * <q>reception in distraction</q> (p. 269):  <q>the distracted masses absorb the work of art into themselves</q>
    
    * The power of habit &mdash; training ground for new perceptions

# Reception in Distraction
<br>
> Even the distracted person can form habits. What is more, the ability to master certain tasks in a state of distraction proves that their performance has become habitual. The sort of distraction that is provided by art repre­sents a covert measure of the extent to which it has become possible to per­form new tasks of apperception. Since, moreover, individuals are tempted to evade such tasks, art will tackle the most difficult and most important tasks wherever it is able to mobilize the masses. It does so currently in film.

# Conclusions

* On the one hand, these technological developments and the new political use-value of art are incorporated into Fascist political agendas, which really try to revive old ideas about myth and ritual

> The increasing proletarianization of modern man and the increasing forma­tion of masses are two sides of the same process. Fascism attempts to orga­nize the newly proletarianized masses while leaving intact the property rela­tions which they strive to abolish. It sees its salvation in granting expression to the masses-but on no account granting them rights.  The masses have a right to changed property relations; fascism seeks to give them expression in keeping these relations unchanged. _The logical outcome of fascism is an aestheticizing of political life._ (269)

# Conclusions

* On the one hand, these technological developments and the new political use-value of art are incorporated into Fascist political agendas, which really try to revive old ideas about myth and ritual

* On the other hand, the new media may also contain within themselves the potential for new, revolutionary uses: the politicization of art.

> But as soon as the criterion of authenticity ceases to be applied to artistic production, the whole social function of art is revolution­ized. Instead of being founded on ritual, it is based on a different practice: politics. (256-257)
