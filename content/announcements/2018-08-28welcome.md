Welcome to "Introduction to Visual Culture"!  We're looking forward to a great Fall semester and hope that you'll find this introduction to the field of visual and media studies engaging and challenging.

Our goal is to equip you with the conceptual and critical tools necessary for further coursework in VMS, as well as to faciliate a foundational understanding of how images and practices of seeing / being seen matter in the contemporary world, and how historical regimes of visuality continue to shape the present.

Looking forward to getting to know each of you in class, during our office hours, and at the various arts- and media-related events on campus!

Speaking of events, here are two that might be of interest:
